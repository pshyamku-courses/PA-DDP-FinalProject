## Brief Description of the project



## Data Source
This dataset of U.S. mortality trends since 1900 highlights contains age-adjusted death rates for five selected major causes of death. The dataset has three fields - 

- Year (number)
- Selected Major Cause of Death (plain text)
- Age adjusted Death Rate (number).

AGE-ADJUSTED DEATH RATE (AADR) is a death rate that controls for the effects of differences in population age distributions. When comparing across geographic areas, some method of ageadjusting is typically used to control for the influence that different population age distributions might have on health event rates.
