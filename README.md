## Goal of this project
This repository contains the code required for the final Peer-graded assignment in the developing data products course on coursera.

The goal for this project is to setup a shiny app deployment of a data product. The data product uses mortality data available from the Center for Disease Control (CDC). The data is presented on the web app and the data is also used to forecast the future trends in mortality for a selected set of causes of death in the U.S.

The app is deployed on shinyapps.io

## Data Source
This dataset of U.S. mortality trends since 1900 highlights contains age-adjusted death rates for five selected major causes of death. The dataset has three fields - 

- Year (number)
- Selected Major Cause of Death (plain text)
- Age adjusted Death Rate (number).

AGE-ADJUSTED DEATH RATE (AADR) is a death rate that controls for the effects of differences in population age distributions. When comparing across geographic areas, some method of ageadjusting is typically used to control for the influence that different population age distributions might have on health event rates. 

The dataset was downloaded from [here](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/nchs-age-adjusted-death-rates-selected-major-causes-death) on October 31, 2020
